"""
This is a template for a MCP server deployed to Google Cloud Run service.


A Model Context Protocol (MCP) compatible server providing two endpoints: 
    /api/search_local_docs for hybrid search (Chroma Vector + BM25) against a local document store.
    /api/search_web for external web search using Tavily.

FastAPI is utilized to create the MCP server.

This script will be packaged into a container and configured to run as a Cloud Run Job.
A Cloud Storage volume mount is used to create a bridge between the Cloud Storage bucket
and the Cloud Run container's file system.
Volume mounts allow a container (this script) to access files stored in persistent disks or NFS shares as if they were local.
The feature leverages Cloud Storage FUSE to provide this file system interface.  
When a Cloud Run GCS mount is configured, the bucket name and munt path are explicitly specified.



Overall architecture implemented for Cloud Run deployment:
- The application requires access to persistent files, like the .env configuration, which are stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Bucket. 
  Since GCS is object storage (not a file system), a bridge is needed.  
  GCS FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is a feature provided by Cloud Run that mounts the GCS bucket. 
  It makes the remote bucket contents appear as a local directory (e.g., /mnt/storage) inside the container.
- The Python FastAPI application, running with Uvicorn, provides the necessary control flow to handle the FUSE delay.
- The Dockerfile's CMD command starts the Uvicorn web server immediately. 
  This allows the server to start listening on port 8080 right away, preventing the immediate "nothing listening" timeout.
- The gcloud run deploy command starts the container and hits /ready. The /ready endpoint returns 503 until the FUSE mount is ready.
- Once /ready returns 200 OK, Cloud Run considers the deployment healthy and proceeds with the application startup sequence, which includes calling the lifespan function.
- The lifespan function executes, and initializes all your application components such as load_dotenv based on the environment variables.
- Only after the lifespan block successfully completes does the application truly yield, allowing the server to accept live user traffic.


Google Cloud Run local, ephemeral /tmp directory:
- The /tmp directory is ephemeral, meaning it does not persist across container lifetimes.
- The /tmp directory is a tmpfs (temporary file system) that uses the container's allocated RAM, not separate disk space.
  Therefore, the size of the files in /tmp directly counts against your Cloud Run instance's total memory limit.
  If the total memory usage (App RAM + /tmp files) exceeds the container's memory limit, the container will be terminated with an Out-of-Memory error.
  The maximum memory for a Cloud Run instance is 32 GiB.
- Files in /tmp are not shared between different running container instances of your service.
- While using /tmp is much faster than GCSFUSE, the I/O operations still consume your container's CPU and memory resources.


Google Cloud Storage FUSE Mount:
- GCSFUSE is an object storage interface, not a POSIX-compliant filesystem.
- Concurrency: Simultaneous writes to the same object from multiple mounts can lead to data loss, as only the first completed write is saved.
- File Locking and Patching: File locking and in-place file patching are not supported; only whole objects can be written to Cloud Storage.
- Cloud Storage FUSE has significantly higher latency than local file systems and is not recommended for latency-sensitive workloads like databases or applications requiring sub-millisecond random I/O and metadata access.
- Transient errors can occur during read/write operations, so applications should be designed to tolerate such errors.
- Not suitable for workloads with frequent small file operations (under 50 MB), data-intensive training, or checkpoint/restart workloads during the I/O intensive phase.
